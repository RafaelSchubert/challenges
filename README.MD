# A Few Challenges

One day I had a look at my GitHub profile, looked at my files at home, and thought: _"well, it's quite empty there."_

And here we are. I uploaded a few things that I had done -- but not all -- just so anyone could have a look at my code and judge it by themselves as they see fit.

Each folder contains challenges written in a specific programming language.

Each project should have its own README file with a short description. If not, it's because I didn't add it yet.
